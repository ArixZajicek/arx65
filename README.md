Another modular 6502 emulator. 

The goal for this project is to make yet another 6502 instruction set emulator that can be implemented into several different systems depending on modules used. 

The current stage of this project is testing valid opcodes. All valid opcodes are theoretically implemented, but testing them properly is the difficult and laborious part.
